Farmer suicides have become an urgent social problem which governments around the
world are trying hard to solve. Most farmers are driven to suicide due to an inability to sell
their produce at desired profit levels, which is caused by the widespread
uncertainty/fluctuation in produce prices resulting from varying market conditions. To
prevent farmer suicides, this project takes the first step towards resolving the issue of produce
price uncertainty by presenting Predicting Agricultural Produce Price Using Convolutional
Neural Network, a deep learning algorithm for accurate prediction of future produce prices
based on past pricing and volume patterns. Our project addresses the three major
contributions:
(i) we gather real-world daily price and (produced) volume data of different crops
over a period of 10 years from an official Indian government administered website.
(ii) we pre-process this raw dataset via state-of-the-art imputation techniques to
account for missing data entries.
(iii) Our project proposes a novel wide and deep neural network architecture which
consists of convolutional neural network models(trained for pricing).
